Tech used: HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript

How It's Made: When creating this website I focused on making it functional first before I went in and applied the CSS. I created the basic layout on HTML with multiple sections that contained the elements that would be added. For this particular website I created multiple functions for when the player plays each weapon, and two for loop that compared the players and robots weapons. I also implemented Math.random in order to be able to randomize the weapon the player used and provide it with a value that determined if they win.

Lessons Learned: Through this project particular project I was able to become more comfortable using functions, for loops, and Math.random.
